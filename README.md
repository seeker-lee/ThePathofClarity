Notes from a stage of quiet exploration — not a guide, but a trace of thought in research.

## Prologue: I just do what I can do

It's a great honor to share my research and feelings.   
I would like to share a real, meaningful thing.    
Again, I don't teach anybody;    
in fact, from the process, I did research,   
I really strongly, and I just know very little;  
the unknown is vast to me.
